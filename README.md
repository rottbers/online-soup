# Online soup ðŸ¥£

Order soup online within Stockholm without needing an account.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** you can place orders, but unfortunately there won't be any soup arriving. _Why?_ It's a prototype, not a real business ðŸ¤·.
> This is my implementation of a case for a fictional soup delivery business created as part of a UX course @ KYH.
